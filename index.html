    <p class="text-center font-semibold text-xl mb-2">The truth is, we all face hardships of some kind, and you never know the struggles a person is going through. Behind every smile, there's a story of a personal struggle.</p>

    <p class="text-center font-semibold text-xl mb-2">Struggle is an unavoidable part of self-employment. Nothing ever comes easy, when you are trying to build towards your dreams. Difficulties and hardship, will be your constant companions. But there have been people before you. There have been people, who passed through a similar struggle, as you are doing now. And, there are people, who are facing it right now. You are certainly not alone in your struggle.</p>
